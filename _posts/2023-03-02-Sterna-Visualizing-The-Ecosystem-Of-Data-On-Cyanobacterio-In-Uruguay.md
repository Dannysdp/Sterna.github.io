In recent years, the presence of cyanobacteria on the coast of Uruguay has become an increasingly important topic for researchers and environmentalists. To help better understand this issue, a new project called Sterna has been developed.

Sterna is a network of nodes containing papers about cyanobacteria in Uruguay. Each node contains important information such as the title, author, DOI, description and tags. The goal of Sterna is to help visualize the ecosystem of data, papers and authors related to this topic.+

To create this network, papers were added to an Excel file and then a Python script was used to read the file and create markdown files for the Obsidian program to read. This allowed for easy organization and visualization of the data.

With Sterna, researchers and environmentalists can now easily access and understand the wealth of information available on cyanobacteria in Uruguay. This will undoubtedly aid in efforts to address this important issue.

It is worth noting that a significant percentage of Uruguayâ€™s population lives near its coast about 70%.

Additionally, there has been an increase in papers about cyanobacteria with a focus on Uruguay over the last decade.
